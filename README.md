# Smart Electricity Monitor
### Smart Electricity Monitor is a IoT project that is intended to automate the manual Electricity Bill calculation done in the EB department in India. This Documentation covers the detailed implementation of this project.

## Problem Statement
As of now, the Readings for the total units consumed is documented manually. A Electrician visits every household once in a month to collecte the monthly readings and if the owner is not available at the particular day, It is the owner's responsibility to visit the local EB office to provide the readings for the month or else the current month's Billing is coupled with the previous month which increases the amount payable since the per unit cost increases with the increase in number of units consumed per month.

## Solution Proposed
The proposed solution is to automate the Readings collection process by using a IoT enabled device to periodically update the readings to the cloud so that the readings calculation and payment can be done in online. Along with this the proposed project provides other features for managing power usage efficiently.
